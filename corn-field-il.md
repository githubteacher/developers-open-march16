## Corn field :corn:

### Places to go :dancer:
- There really aren't many
- You could go to the post office maybe

### Nom Nom Nom :hamburger:
- The Mexican restaurant is OK I guess
- There's that other bar
- I think that's it

### Where to sleep :zzz:
- My house or outside if you're desperate
- There are hotels like 10 miles away
- The lot next door is also abandoned
