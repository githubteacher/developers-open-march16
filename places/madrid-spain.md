### Good places to eat
Pro-tip Spanish food is so much more than just tapas and paella. Don't go to places that look super touristy, try and find something more authentic.

Spanish food is all about the ingredients, it's not fancy cuisine with sauces etc. But it's all about good quality ingredients, with delicious flavours.

- Mercado San Miguel - awesome lunch stalls
